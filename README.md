# ðŸ§¬ Counting-DNA-Nucleotides ðŸ§¬

I have attempted to modify a ROSALIND bioinformatics problem for counting DNA nucleotides (https://rosalind.info/problems/dna/). The original problem asked for individuals to take a given DNA string and return the frequency of 4 unique letters: "A", "C", "T", and "G". 

In this project, I have made a solution that accepts any unique DNA sequence and then validates it by ensuring that the unique input contains only the 4 letters previously mentioned. The validation process also ensures that case-sensitivity is avoided when given any input by the user. Once the sequence has been validated, the validated sequence will be returned as well as the frequencies of the 4 unique letters.
